Put PEM encoded self signed CA certificate files of proxy, private 
Docker registry and so here. 

Files should have pem extension.

Make sure certificates are self signed. You can check it by changing
the file extension to crt and open it in Windows. Under General tab
you should see the same description in Issued to and Issued by fields.
